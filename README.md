Hello Udacity's mentor, my name is Hien. Here is my capstone project. In this project, I selected Serverless approach and reuse the project in course 4 which I finished before.

In this project, I implemented some new feature:

1. Keep user's login session after they refesh browser: 
In original project, if we refesh browser, the application will display Login button again, I think this point is so annoying and I decided to change it by using localStorage.

2. Update UI:
I enhance todos UI is more beautiful than the original. I learned how to use Gird in sematic ui and change the component.

3. Pagination
That the things I learned after study in Udacity course 4, I created page size/limit variable and 2 button: Next and Previous.

4. Refresh page after create new item
I decide to refresh page after create new todo item in order to update with newest data.

Evidence Image Folder
In this repo, I also created a folder name images/evidence to capture any screenshot related to deploy, resource.

And finally,
Thank you for reading, mentor.
